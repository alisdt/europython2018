EuroPython2018 Materials

## OpenSpace - Teaching Python to Beginners

### Topics to discuss
1.	Focus on the subject (especially children)
2.	Emotional aspect (confidence and fear)
3.	Subject matter for teaching (ways to start)
4.	Conceptual difficulties
5.	Different abilities among students
6.	Order of teaching concepts
7.	PC/tools/stuff to teach
### Discussion Notes
1.	__Emotional aspect__
 *	Support who wants work hard
 *	Provide ways for little successes
 *	Motivation
 *	Show students that even teacher can make mistake, but it is easy to overtake them
 *	Never say: Don’t worry – it is easy. Say: Why not give it a try?
 *	Avoid red error messages
 *	Show/use student’s solution as an example

2.	__Keeping focus__
 * Keep focus, keep them in a flow - Mihály Csíkszentmihályi - [wiki/Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))
 * Set the goals (long term on shorter) – real problems to solve
 * Interesting/bright/visual goal, not necessarily practical 
 * Right level of complexity, not to simple, not to hard

3. __Subject matter for teaching (ways to start)__
 * Game goals good way to start
 * Visual goals
 * Jypiter Notebooks with widgets - keeps things visual and interactive
 * Challenging tasks (test driver teaching!)
 * Teach <subject> in hard way (books by Zed Shaw)

4. __Conceptual difficulties__
 * Explain in different words (functions for maths are confusing)
 * Don’t push on some subject if it is not critical, probably they come to it later
 * other students may explain to the fellow. It helps develop personal relationships, build a team
 * involve students to be function/variable/turtle/class – make it real life.

   DEBUG async code with people per function!
 * Teach two languages at the time – to show that language is not the goal, it is interchangeable

5. __Different abilities among students__
 * Involve other students to help other, especially for the problem he can solve
 * Take last year students as assistants
 * People that attend but does not want to do anything. They just want it to happen

   Make format less academic – make it a workshop
   
   Provide lecture in advance as recording, make it interactive during the class
   
 * Group students with mixed level (but not to different levels)
 * Have some simple materials for slow students, have more difficult tasks for advanced
 * Have prepared flow, so most of the audience can flow by themselves, and you focus on blocked folks
